    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI)<br /> refers to the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically
        associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and
        decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software
        that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that
        maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] Such machines may be called AIs.</p>
